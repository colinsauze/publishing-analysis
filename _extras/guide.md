Points to remember
* Pushing from GitHub to Zenodo (or at least the sandbox) takes a considerable amount of
  time. At least 30 minutes in first workshop.
* If you use a separate user account for running training, it must have write access
  to the Anaconda environment, and you must have GUI access to display the Matplotlib
  windows. Ideally, run at the desktop of that account, with a local Anaconda install,
  rather than e.g. going via SSH.
