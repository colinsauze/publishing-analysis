title: "Verifying your analysis"
teaching: 20
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I check that my analysis is working?"
- "How do I verify that the environment definition is correct?"
objectives:
- "Be able to test that an analysis gives correct result."
- "Be able to use MyBinder to test code in a clean environment."
keypoints:
- "Running your full analysis end-to-end in a clean environment will highlight most problems."
- "Binder services (e.g. MyBinder) will create an environment in the cloud based on your definiiton."

> ## Testing, testing
>
> Create a clean Conda environment on your computer based on the specification,
> in the `challenge` repository, and use it to re-run the analysis. Does it work,
> and give the same results as when running it in the environment you were previously
> using?
>
> If not, try to work out (or ask a helper) why the results are different.

> ## Another Binder
>
> Start a MyBinder instance for your `challenge` repository. Try running the full workflow
> on MyBinder. Does it gives the same results as you see running on your own machine?
>
> If not, try to work out (or ask a helper) why the results are different.
