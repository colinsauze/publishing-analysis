title: "Publishing in open science repositories"
teaching: 15
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How is an open science repository different to something like GitHub?"
- "How do I create a permanent version of record of my code?"
- "How can I create a DOI for my code and cite it?"
objectives:
- "Understand the difference between the various types of repository."
- "Understand how to push a repository from GitHub to Zenodo."
- "Be able to find the DOI for a repository and cite it."
keypoints:
- "Source code hosts like GitHub are designed for active development of software. Open science repositories are to keep versions of record for the longer term."
- "Services like Zenodo allow you to package a particular commit, archive it, and give it a permanent identifier."
- "Many services like Zenodo will automatically give you a DOI for any dataset, including repositories pulled from GitHub."
- "DOIs for code repositories can be cited in journal articles the same way as any other publication."

> ## Home turf
>
> Try and find your own institution's policy on open access. Does it have a
> local repository for source code (or research data more generally), or
> recommendations on where to publish it?

> ## Fitting in
>
> Are there any discipline-specific repositories for data or code that are in
> use in your discipline?
>
> Discuss with a neighbour, or in breakout rooms.

> ## Versioning
>
> Wei published the analysis code for his last publication about bat biomechanics
> on Zenodo. Now he has prepared a new paper about squirrel biomechanics, making
> use of a lot of the same code, but with some modifications to make it applicable
> to squirrels rather than bats. He is wondering how best to publish this modified
> code. What would be the best option for Wei?
>
> 1. Publish the new version of the code entirely separately, with
>    a citation to the bat code.
> 2. Publish the new version of the code entirely separately, with no mention of
>    the bat code.
> 3. Create a new version of the previous published code on Zenodo, and update
>    the metadata to indicate that the code is now squirrel-specific.
> 4. Keep the updated code on GitHub, but keep citing the DOI for the bat version
>    of the code, since it links back to GitHub where the updated code is.
> 5. Something else?
