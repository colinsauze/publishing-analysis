title: Setup

## Software installation

For this lesson, you will need a Unix shell, the Git version control system,
and the Python programming language. If you don't have these installed, the
instructions at the [Software Carpentry workshop template][swc-workshop]
will guide you through installing them.


## SSH keys

If you have not previously used GitHub with SSH keys (for example, because you
came to a Software Carpentry workshop before GitHub required them), then you
will need to set these up.

There is a guide to this in section 3 of 
[episode 7 of the Software Carpentry Introduction to Git lesson][swc-github-keys].


## Download data

We will be working with an example piece of code borrowed from the book
[Research Software Engineering in Python][py-rse].

Download the [zipf archive](/files/zipf.zip) and extract it to your Desktop.
