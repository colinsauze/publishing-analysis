This lesson will discuss how you (and why) you can publish the software used to enable your
research.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assumes familiarity with the [Git][git-novice] version control system,
> the [Python][python-novice-inflammation] programming language,
> and will also touch on using the [Unix shell][shell-novice]. If these are not familiar to you, 
> then it would be worth trying to go to a Software Carpentry workshop before trying to work through
> this one. If you are unable to go, you can work through the notes linked for each topic above,
> which is the same material as a Software Carpentry workshop would cover.
