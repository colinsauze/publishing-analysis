title: "Publishing in open science repositories"
teaching: 15
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How is an open science repository different to something like GitHub?"
- "How do I create a permanent version of record of my code?"
- "How can I create a DOI for my code and cite it?"
objectives:
- "Understand the difference between the various types of repository."
- "Understand how to push a repository from GitHub to Zenodo."
- "Be able to find the DOI for a repository and cite it."
keypoints:
- "Source code hosts like GitHub are designed for active development of software. Open science repositories are to keep versions of record for the longer term."
- "Services like Zenodo allow you to package a particular commit, archive it, and give it a permanent identifier."
- "Many services like Zenodo will automatically give you a DOI for any dataset, including repositories pulled from GitHub."
- "DOIs for code repositories can be cited in journal articles the same way as any other publication."
