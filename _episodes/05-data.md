title: "Introduction"
teaching: 10
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How do I get data for my code to work on?"
- "Where should I store data?"
- "Should data be published?"
objectives:
- "Be able to pull data from data repositories to operate on."
- "Understand options around keeping data with or separate from code."
- "Be aware of options around data publication."
keypoints:
- "Use `curl` to download data automatically."
- "For small amounts of data, and code that is specifically to analyse only those data, data and code can be stored and published together."
- "For large datasets, or where code is used for multiple different datasets, keep the two separate."
- "Data can be frequently be published, if there are no constraints preventing it. If data are not published, then publishing analysis code becomes less valuable."
